      <h2>Section 3 ‚Äì Client Communication Draft</h2>
      <div class="letter">
        <p>Dear John,</p>

        <p>We thank you for allowing us the opportunity to assist you with your taxation needs. 
        We are pleased to enclose your Income Tax Return for the year ended 30 June 2025.</p>

        <p>Please review the Income Tax Return marked ‚ÄòClient Copy‚Äô attached to this letter. 
        Please note that the income tax calculation is an estimate only, as PAYG Instalments 
        and other disclosures in the return are dependent on the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) 
        cross-referencing these amounts.</p>

        <!-- Embedded flagged items -->
        <div class="issue-block">
          <h3><span class="icon">‚ö†Ô∏è</span>Work-Related Expenses</h3>
          <p>Your work-related expenses are up 40% compared to last year. 
          We will need you to confirm substantiation (e.g., receipts or a logbook).
          <br><em>This is an ATO focus area for 2025.</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="issue-block">
          <h3><span class="icon">‚ö†Ô∏è</span>Rental Property</h3>
          <p>Your interest deductions have increased by 30% compared to last year. 
          Please confirm whether any loan redraws or private use are included, 
          and check if any capital improvements were coded as repairs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="issue-block">
          <h3><span class="icon">‚ö†Ô∏è</span>Cryptocurrency / CGT</h3>
          <p>We have identified cryptocurrency disposals this year. Some assets were held 
          for more than 12 months, which may qualify for the CGT discount. 
          Please ensure cost base records are available.</p>

        <div class="issue-block carried">
          <h3><span class="icon">üìÇ</span>CGT Disposal ‚Äì Carried Forward to FY2026</h3>
          <p>The sale of Asset XYZ is not included in this year‚Äôs return, as the contract date 
          was 12 July 2025. This event has been carried forward to FY2026 and supporting 
          documents have been retained.</p>

        provided us for the preparation of your income tax return is true and correct and that you

        do not have these records, or have any questions about the necessary records, 
        please contact us.</p>

        income tax refund] of $xxx.xx. This amount has been calculated based on a taxable income 
        of $xx,xxx.xx.<br>

        [IF RELEVANT] The amount of Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) repaid was $xx,xxx.xx.</p>
